Description: 
    SMiXcanK provides a multi-cell-type-aware transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS). 
    The package integrates bulk expression data with estimated cell-type 
    proportions, enabling the decomposition of genetic effects into shared and 
    cell-type-specific components across K cell types.  
    It includes tools for estimating cell-type fractions, and performing cell-type-resolved association analysis. 
    The methodology extends MiXcan to allow simultaneous modeling of multiple 
    biological cell types, improving interpretability and statistical power in 
    TWAS of complex tissues.
